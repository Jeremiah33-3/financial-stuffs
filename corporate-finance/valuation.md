## Key Concepts & Equations

### Beta
The beta (β) of an investment security (i.e., a stock) is a measurement of its volatility of returns relative to the entire market, typically benchmarked against a broad market index, like the S&P 500.
> Beta = Covariance (Re, Rm) / Variance (Rm)

Levered beta, also known as equity beta or stock beta, is the volatility of returns for a stock, taking into account the impact of the company’s leverage from its capital structure. It compares the volatility (risk) of a levered company to the risk of the market. Levered beta includes both business risk and the risk that comes from taking on debt. It is also commonly referred to as “equity beta” because it is the volatility of an equity based on its capital structure.
> Unlevered β = Levered β / ((1 + (1 – Tax Rate) * (Debt / Equity))

Asset beta, or unlevered beta, on the other hand, shows the risk of an unlevered company relative to the market. It includes business risk but does not include leverage risk.
> Levered Beta = Unlevered Beta * ((1 + (1 – Tax Rate) * (Debt / Equity))

### Types of cash flows
Cash Flow (CF) is the increase or decrease in the amount of money a business, institution, or individual has. In finance, the term is used to describe the amount of cash (currency) that is generated or consumed in a given time period.

1. Operating CF
OCF = Net Income + Depre & Amort +/- non-cash items +/- changes in net working capital

2. Investing CF
Investing CF = Net capital expenditure (CAPEX)

3. Financing CF
Financing CF = + net debt proceeds + net equity proceeds

4. Free CF to Firm (FCFF) or Unlevered CF
UCF = Net income + depre & amort +/- non cash items +/- changes in net working capital - net capital expenditure + interest exp * (1 - t)
OR UCF = EBIT(1 -t) + depre & amort +/- non cash items +/- changes in net working capital - net capital expenditure

5. Free Cash flow to equity (FCFE) or Levered Free CF (LCF)
FCFE = Net Income + depre & amort +/- non cash items +/- changes in net working capital - net capital expenditure +/- net debt proceeds
