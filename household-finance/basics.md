## Strategies I found interesting

### Satellite allocation ([Core-Satellite Investing Strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/core-satellite-investing.asp))

[Resources](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/articles/nav/investing/what-is-a-core-satellite-portfolio) from DBS.

Core-satellite investing combines passive and active strategies to reduce costs and achieve potential outperformance. The core consists of passive investments that track market indices like the S&P 500. Satellites are actively managed investments aiming for better returns than the passive core.

The core usually forms 60-80% of the investable funds, determined largely by risk tolerance and purpose of the funds (long term/short term).
